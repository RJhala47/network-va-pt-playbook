# 🔐 Network Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing Playbook

This repository contains a **practical, real-world Network VA/PT playbook** designed for hands-on security assessments in enterprise environments.

🧠 Built for engineers and testers who want **repeatable**, **defensible**, and **tool-aware** testing  
🛠 Covers the full lifecycle — from scoping and recon to exploitation, cleanup, and reporting  
📋 Includes commands, workflows, checklists, and tool-specific guidance (Nessus, Qualys, Nmap, Metasploit)

## 🎯 Purpose
This playbook is intended for:
- Internal and external network assessments  
- Vulnerability validation (not just scanner output)  
- Authorized penetration testing activities  
- Consistent, audit-safe engagement execution  

⚠️ **Warning**  
Use this playbook **only** on systems you own or have **explicit written authorization** to test.

This repository is meant to be **used during engagements** — copy it, extend it, and tailor it to your tooling and environment over time 🚀
